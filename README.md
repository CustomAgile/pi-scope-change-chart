Portfolio Item Scope Change Chart
=================================

Barry Mullan / Heather Kanser (December 2015) 

## Overview

Install this app in a Release filtered dashboard page. 

This app requires a SAAS subscription as it uses the lookback api.

## Overview

This chart visualizes the change in feature commitment during a release / program increment. This will be useful to determine if changes in scope are impacting delivery of original scope. It uses the concept of a baseline which can either be based on the first day of the release or at the end of the first sprint.

Features not in the original baseline will be shown "below the line" while features removed will be removed from the top. 

Clicking on any series will open a tabbed panel below. The 'Series' tab shows the features in the selected series. The 'Change' tab shows all features added or removed since the baseline.
